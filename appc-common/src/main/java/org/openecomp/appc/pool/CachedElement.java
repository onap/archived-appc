     * element). If he is, then we don't really close it, but instead release the element that we are wrapping back to
     * the free pool. Once this has happened, we mark the element as "closed" (from the perspective of this dynamic

     * For convenience, we also implement the <code>getWrappedObject</code> method so that the dynamic proxy can be
     * called to obtain the actual wrapped object if desired. Note, to use this method, the caller would have to invoke
     * it through reflection.
